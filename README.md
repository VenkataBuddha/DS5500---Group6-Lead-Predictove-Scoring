# DS5500---Group6-Lead-Predictove-Scoring
This project aimed to implement an effective 
classification method for lead scoring. We used an 
educational company’s dataset, i.e., publicly available 
on Kaggle. and I focused on implementing multiple 
classification algorithms. A particular issue over each 
classification implementation was imputing” missing” 
data points and choosing the right features to fit in the 
model. In-depth data analysis led to meaningful
insights, that would help in improving the efficiency of 
lead conversions. While building a model, I am also 
trying to assign a lead score to each of the leads such 
that the lead with higher lead score have a higher 
conversion chance and the lead with lower lead score 
have a lower conversion chance.
